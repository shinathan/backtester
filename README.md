# Loop-based Backtesting
Using the functions written from my [polygon database](https://github.com/shinathan/polygon.io-stock-database) project, I can backtest strategies. Instead of fully event-driven and OOP, there is only 1 object: the Portfolio. 

The first notebook explains how loop-backtesting works and also recaps all functions created in the database project. All other notebooks are backtests and analysis on different strategies.

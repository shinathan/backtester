    "# Loop-based backtesting\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "* The trading logic is straightforward to code.\n",
    "* You can do way more custom stuff more easily, such as stoplosses and takeprofits. I would have no idea how to implement these in vectorized backtesting.\n",
    "* It resembles live trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Slow\n",
    "* Possible to introduce look-ahead bias. To avoid this, you should be very careful with which data you access. If a backtest looks very good, cross-check the entry/exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to make this backtester as simple as possible. In my other repo QS_Extended, almost everything was OOP. However I find that this makes things a bit more complicated. So here I will avoid OOP unless it is absolutely necessary. For the Portfolio that is the case. I would have no idea how you would code something that simulates a portfolio with multi-asset, internal logs etc. without encasing it in an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects and helper functions are in the 'backtester' folder."
